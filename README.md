# Encoder-Decoder Architecture and Comparison with Attention Mechanisms 

## Overview

The Encoder-Decoder architecture is widely used in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. However, traditional Encoder-Decoder models face challenges in handling long sequences due to the fixed-length context vector, which can lead to information loss. Attention mechanisms were introduced to mitigate this problem by allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each decoding step.

## Attention Mechanisms Comparison

We implemented and compared three different attention mechanisms to analyze their impact on model performance:

### 1. Bahdanau’s Attention (Additive Attention)

Introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014), this mechanism uses a feed-forward neural network to compute attention scores.

It improves alignment between the input and output sequences by dynamically weighting input tokens.

Computationally expensive due to additional parameters in the attention network.

### 2. Dot-Product Attention

A simpler and more efficient attention mechanism that computes similarity between encoder hidden states and decoder hidden states using dot-product multiplication.

Computationally faster since it avoids extra parameters.

Can suffer from scaling issues with large hidden states.

### 3. Luong’s Attention (Multiplicative Attention)

Introduced by Luong et al. (2015), this mechanism modifies dot-product attention by incorporating a scaling factor.

Offers both global attention (considers all encoder states) and local attention (focuses on a subset of encoder states).

More efficient than Bahdanau’s attention but slightly less flexible in handling long dependencies.

## Results and Observations

Bahdanau’s Attention provided better alignment in complex sequence tasks but was computationally expensive.

Dot Attention was faster but sometimes less effective in capturing dependencies in longer sequences.

Luong’s Attention balanced efficiency and accuracy, making it a practical choice for many applications.

## Conclusion

The choice of attention mechanism depends on the specific task and computational constraints. Bahdanau’s attention is ideal for high-accuracy applications with ample computational resources, while Dot and Luong’s attention mechanisms offer efficient alternatives with varying trade-offs.
